### Stage 1: Projects

After Stage 0, once you have received a response from us, you will be assigned project(s). At this stage, you need to pick a development field like web development, android app development, etc. You will need to first learn the fundamentals of the field you pick. For e.g., if you pick Android, you will be asked to complete the[ Android course. ](https://www.udacity.com/course/new-android-fundamentals--ud851)

We will link any appropriate links, guidelines, including deadlines for you in the response mail (after you are done with stage 0), so don't worry. A typical period for this stage may range from 20-40 days. 

We believe in deadlines and we respect deadlines. If for any reason that you are not able to complete it, you are always free to tell us that in form of a reply email to the main thread. In case of no follow-up from your side, you will be removed from the pipeline and demoted back to Stage 0. 

After you have the fundamentals, you will need to complete the assigned project(s). Example of projects that may be assigned: Instagram clone, survey app, chat app, etc. 

Once you are done with the assigned projects and once you have achieved the required outputs, you will** need to reply** to the original mail (that you sent for Stage 0) with the appropriate submission repository links. 

For example, in our previous example, once you reply to the same email you sent before, it will look something like this:

![](<.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>)

You will receive a response from us within 10 days, followed by follow-ups which may include a video interview.



### Stage 2: Contribution

After you have received a response from us after completing Stage 1, you will be asked to contribute to any of[ amFOSS projects](https://gitlab.com/amfoss/). For this, you will need to learn to how to send a pull request and learn the basics of Git. 

The guidelines along with deadlines will be specified in the mail that we send to you once you complete Stage 1.
