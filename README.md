# Fresher's Contest - FOSS@Amrita

This test is meant for the people who are interested in joining the [FOSS@Amrita](https://github.com/amfoss) club.
Follow the below tasks and submit a Issue in this repository so that we can check your progress among all the people.

## Base Rules

**You are not allowed to use GUI-based navigation/operations like Editing, Unzipping, etc., but are excepted to find out solution with your coding and commanding skills** - you are accountable to show us ```proof of work```, by creating your own repository named `tasks-amfoss` which will contain whatever work you do for the test. Push all your codes and screenshots to the repository. For avoiding malpractice, make your repository as  _private_  so that no one can take your code. Make it _public_ before you submit.

**Plagrism will not be entertained** - You are allowed to refer to any online portal, tutorials, forum-answers etc. but copying your code from your friends (or as such from any online source) is strictly forbidden. 

**Note that Individuals can be disqualified from the test at the organisers' discretion.** Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the competition rules, or other unsporting behaviour.

Oswald and Weenie want their picture to be hanged on the wall, but their foolish photograher he gave them a manipulated image. Can you help them to fix it? Byw, they also wanted it to be a Grayscale image. So, get's started  and go earn some *Good Karma*. :)

You will get the picture by running this below command.

### 3.  Correct your Emails

Last night, someone from DRPK had sneaked into our system, and manipulated all of your emails in our records. We are unsure of the mistakes that might have crept in, and want you guys to fix them for us.  We host our records right here in this repository, in a markdown file in this repository. Go ahead  and correct *your* email. Create a branch named `#<1>-<email>-fix` and send a PR. Remember to have a meaningful commit messsage, ofc. :grin:

> **Help**: [Git Branch](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-branch/1.7.10), [Pull Requests](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests)

---------------------------

### 4.  Here is an exciting Contest!

We know that you all love Problem Solving, and have planned a special contest for you! Are you ready?  
Oops, we have slight problem! We have lost the link generated in the morning and we have contacted the Police to find it. May be you should try too (You guys are Problem-Solver's afterall). Untill then, you can proceed to solve the below challenge. :point_down:

> BTW, remember that the Hackerrank challenge link always starts with the URL, https://www.hackerrank.com/

---------------------------

### 5.  Kim's Gift 

Did you try to open the `hahahaha` file yet? It was left by the DRPK attacker last night, maybe it contains Kim's nuke or some chocolates for you. Who doesn't like chocolates?

> Help
`file a` gives you the details about the file *a* </br>
`touch a` will create new file *a* </br>
`rmdir a` deletes directory *a* </br>
`mv a b` transfers the contents of file *a* to *b* </br>
`chgrp` changes the group ownership of files </br>
For more, you can refer at [CLI Commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities)

---------------------------

### 6. Doval's Secret Agents  

Now comes the most interesting task of all. Wait, before starting I want to ask if you got the SECRET_MESSAGE.

```python
if(SECRET_MESSAGE):
  task.proceed()
else:
  SECRET_MESSAGE.search()
```

The task is simple, host a small website on GitHub pages saying that **SECRET_MESSAGE is "###"** in a Level 3 Header. You can use README or HTML. We don't bother about design but who doesn't like good websites. :blush:

> **Help**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

---------------------------

### 7.  Post it!

We hope you all have a blog. You can write a blog post on your overall experience and how did you solve the tasks. Remember this is also a task but will be evaluated later. You can share the links in the Telegram group along with your status updates at the end of the day.

> **Reference**: You can have a look at some of the previous blog posts of the club members like https://kalidindiamitraja.wordpress.com/2018/10/25/sending-email-with-python/

---------------------------

### 8. Race it, Raise it!  

Once you are done with the 7 tasks above, you are **required** to submit **all your work** which includes your code (or may be even screenshots) so that we can verify that you completed the tasks.
To do that, you must raise an issue in the repository and fill the template.

Here are some more rules (we know you are pro's, just be sure of these) -
1.  Every individual should submit an  **ISSUE**  and fill that template, so that we can evaluate the test. 
2.  The  **ISSUE TEMPLATE**  must be strictly followed. A submission without following the template will considered as  **INVALID**and hence will not be evaluated.
3.  Only a single issue has to be made for each individual, multiple submissions will not be considered.

---------------------------
