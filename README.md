# amfoss-freshers-test

This test is meant for the people who are interested in joining the [FOSS@Amrita](https://github.com/amfoss) club.
Follow the below tasks and submit a Issue in this repository so that we can check your progress among all the people.

## Rules

1. Every individual should submit an **ISSUE** and fill that template, so that we can evaluate the test. Create a github repository with the name, `tasks-amfoss` and push all your codes and screenshots to the repository. For avoiding malpractice, make your repository as *private* so that no one can take your code. Make it public before you submit.
2. The **ISSUE TEMPLATE** must be strictly followed. A submission without following the template will considered as **INVALID** and hence will not be evaluated.
2. Only a single issue has to be made for each individual, multiple submissions will not be considered.
3. Malpractice will not be entertained in the test. You can refer to any references but copying code from your friends is strictly restricted.
4. Individuals can be disqualified from the test at the organisers' discretion. Reasons might include but are not limited to breaking the Competition Rules, or other unsporting behaviour.

## Tasks

0. Star all the [amfoss](https://github.com/amfoss) repositories. :smiley:

> PAUSE: I know you have already starred this repository, but why don't you fork it too. I think you know about fork. If not, please see the top right side and click on the fork button and select the user. That's it! You are awesome. You just forked a repository. Keep on going. :+1:

1. Oswald and Weenie want their picture to be hanged on the wall but the photogragher is mad; he gave them a manipulated image. Can you hellp them correcting the image for them. Also they want a b&w image. So, make sure you keep happy by doing the changes. I know you are awesome and kindly help them - *Good Karma*. :)

You can get the image by running the below command.

2. We would like to hear about you from you. :grinning:

We will be sending a mail to you all with the thread name, `FOSS@Amrita Freshers Introduction Mail`. Write a mail which answers
    - About You
    - What are your interests
    - Why do you want to join FOSS@Amrita
    
> Follow mail etiquettes: https://www.dailywritingtips.com/email-etiquette/

3. There will be an `members.md` file in the `assets` folder, you can find it in this repository. All of your email ids have some mistakes. So, we would like you people to correct the mistake of your email id. Create a branch named `#1-emailid-fix` and make the neccessary change and send a PR to this repository. Have a meaningful commit messsage. :grin:

4. We know that you all love Problem Solving and we too planned a contest. Are you ready? We know that you are always ready for Hackerrank but the problem is we lost the link somewhere and we couldn't find it anywhere. May be you can. Untill then you can solve the below challenge. :point_down:

> BTW, remember that the Hackerrank challenge always starts with the URL, https://www.hackerrank.com/

5. There is one file named, `hahahaha` in the assets folder. I suspect it as a virus. Why don't you try opening it up and tell us about it. 

`file a` gives you the details about the file *a* </br>
`touch a` will create new file *a* </br>
`rmdir a` deletes directory *a* </br>
`mv a b` transfers the contents of file *a* to *b* </br>
`chgrp` changes the group ownership of files </br>
more you can find at [CLI Commands](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Guide_to_Unix/Commands/File_System_Utilities)

6. Now comes the most interesting task of all. Wait, before starting I want to ask if you got the SECRET_MESSAGE.

```python
if(SECRET_MESSAGE):
  task.proceed()
else:
  SECRET_MESSAGE.search()
```

The task is simple, host a small website on GitHub pages saying that **SECRET_MESSAGE is "###"** in a *Level 3 Header*. You can use README or HTML. We don't bother about design but who doesn't like good websites. :blush:

> **Help**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

7. We hope you all have a blog. You can write a blog post on your overall experience and how did you solve the tasks. Remember this is also a task but will be evaluated later. You can share the links in the Telegram group along with your status updates at the end of the day.

8. Open an issue and fill the template. Fill the [feedback form](https://goo.gl/forms/QeU76AlyOTODS0vt1) form too.
