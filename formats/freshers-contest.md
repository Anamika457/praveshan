# Fresher's Contest

Top performers of the Long Challenge will be invited to participate in the Praveshan contest which will be held live at the FOSSLab. 

The contest will be conducted as follows:

1. Contestants are given a fresh set of tasks to be completed within a specified time interval.
2. The solutions to each problem should be stored in a GitHub repository, which will be judged by a panel of faculty and club mentors.
3. Members selected from the contest will be notified as soon as the judging process is complete.

Completion of every task is not mandatory; the quality of the work done and the amount of effort put in are what will be considered during the judging process. For more details about the rules of the contest, check out the [general guidelines](../selection/general-guidelines.md).
