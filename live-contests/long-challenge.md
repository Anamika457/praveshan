# Long Challenge

The Long Challenge primarily involves contributing to [amFOSS projects](https://gitlab.com/amfoss). 

1. **Email Us** - Send us a well-composed email, expressing your interest and motivation for joining the club.
2. **Fix bugs and contribute -** A great starting point would be to have a look at issues in the projects with the label - "Good first bug" or "Junior" or similar tags. 

Interested students are welcome to contribute to these beginner-friendly projects.
