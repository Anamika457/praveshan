# Fresher's Tasks 2020-21

The Freshers Tasks are not out yet.

For now, we suggest you to do some basic things like: 

* [CS-50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/): Watch the lectures and complete the problem sets **\(especially if you are relatively new to Computer Science\)**
* Dual Boot Linux in your laptop \(Ubuntu/Kubuntu is a good choice to begin with\)
* Start using Linux and get used to how it works. Learn some basic commands.
* Try doing [Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

If you're done with all that, you could have a look at the previous year's task doc[ in the Archive](../contest-archive/contest-archive/fresher-tasks.md) and attempt some for fun ;\)
