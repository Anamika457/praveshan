# General Guidelines

The code/steps for each task completed by a participant must be stored in a repository named 'tasks-amfoss' 

Participants are required to make their repository private during the contest. On submission, participants must to change it back to public. 

### **Reduce usage of GUI**

Basic tasks like navigation, editing files and unzipping should not be done using GUI i.e. the use of mouse, window managers and text editors is discouraged. Do as much of your work as possible on your terminal.

### **Google is your best friend**

Participants are allowed to refer to any online source \(tutorials, forums etc.\) for any doubts they may have. Helpful links will mostly be given along with each task description.

### **Plagiarism is strictly prohibited**

As stated above, referring online sources is allowed, but directly copying code from a website is prohibited. Sharing code between participants is also prohibited. Plagiarism checkers will be used to ensure all work done is genuine.

### **Accountability**

Participants are accountable to show the evaluators the proof of their work at any time. 

### **Disqualification**

 Participant\(s\) found violating any of the contest rules or displaying other unsporting behaviours will be subject to immediate disqualification by the organisers.
